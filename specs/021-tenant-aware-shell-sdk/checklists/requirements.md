# Specification Quality Checklist: Tenant-Aware Operator Shell And SDK

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The terms "operator shell" and "SDK" are treated as product surfaces fixed by the upstream Roadmap 36 document, not as newly chosen implementation technology.
- The spec intentionally avoids naming concrete transport headers or framework-specific client APIs; those details are reserved for planning and contracts while preserving the upstream requirement that SDK callers should not construct tenant transport details manually.
